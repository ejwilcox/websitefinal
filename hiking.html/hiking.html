				<h2>Section Overview</h2>
				<p>
					Over 19 days JSP 1/30 (Los Pepitos) traversed 168 km with 6800m of elevation gain from Tamango to 
					Chile Chico through the wilds of Parque Nacional Patagonia. Navigation skills including map, 
					compass, and GPS use were built whilst following the Siete Lagunas track during the first ration
					period providing ample opportunity to bathe in the pristine waters of the region. The second ration
					period saw students takking on daily route planning and management along with the introduction of 
					safe river crossing techniques up to Rio Aviles and into Valle Hermoso. Along the way students 
					learnt what plant and fungi were safe to eaet and the consumption of Calafate, Changle, and Chaura 
					began in earnest. The second re-ration at Lago Verde saw some members of the group summiting an 
					1818m peak whilst others rested, relaxed, went fishing. The third ration period focused on off 
					trail travel including route finding around a waterfall on Estero La Gloria and challenging mountain
					pass into Valle Amarillo o Las Vacas. By this point Los Pepitos were functioning impressively and 
					deemed ready to set out an an independent expedition across the dry and windy espansse surrounding 
					Cerro Pico Sur and descending to the final destinatino of Chile Chico.

				<h2>Journal Entry</h2>
				<h1>Date: 03/19/25</h1>
				<p>One of the longest, most amazing dats of my life. It started by waking up at 4 am after cowboy camping
				under the stars. The wind was immediately noticeable, blowing Max's gaitters back to where we cooked yesteraday.
				We packed up camp and were on foot by 4:40. The moonlight light out path, no headlamps necessary. We 
				followed the mining trail for the first hour, dealing with lot's of wind and peeking at the silhouettes of 
				the mountains around us. Ate our oatmeal under the stars with warm water then pushed on. It was extreme 
				wind the entire time. We kept following the trail until it split in two. We took the wgon way at first and had
				to backtrack. Potentially a 4 km mistake. The sky began to light up orange and red as we passed the other groups tent.
				Erez, our designated leader, gave us an inspirational peptalk for a moment, pushing us to be the first ones at Chile 
				Chico. We sped down the mountain, almost getting blown off once or twice. We took a final short break before getting a 
				spectacular view of the valley below us. We pushed until we reached a highway. For the final stretch, we sipped mate
				and got a picture in front of the Chile Chico sign. Once we made it to town, our attention shifted to finding a milkshake

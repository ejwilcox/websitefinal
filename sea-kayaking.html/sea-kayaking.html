				<h2>Section Overview</h2>
				<p>
					This was a 21 day sea kayak expedition starting in Tortel and travelling out to Isla Sombrero 
					before eventually circumnavigating Isla Merino Jarpa and finishing the route back at Tortel. There 
					were 11 paddle days in total that rangedd between 7 and 25 nautical miles each. There were 14 
					students and 4 instructors in 6 double and 6 single kayaks. The course was a blessing to realize a 
					wide ranging technical paddling curriculum while maintaining a major focus on leadership 
					development, quality camping, staying warm and dry, sense of place activities and classes, LNT 
					camping, and ocean/weather/seapersonship classes.

				<h2>Journal Entry</h2>
				<h1>Date: 02/25/25</h1>
				<p>Im currently at the most beautiful place that I've ever been. Pta. Raquel. Under the most painted sky
				I've ever seen. It is completely covered in stars. Today was one of the most rearding days of my entire life
				Woke up at 5:30, boiled water, got line ready with some mate. Started kayaking at point boat. 26.2 nautical miles in total.
				Every time I blinked, I felt like I was staring at a new painting. What an unreal landscape. Had some great conversations, 
				specifically with Avery since we were in the same boat for the final stretch. She complimented me for being 
				"extremely likeable" which meant a lot. During the last mile we raced Shay and Izzy. We were all completely in awe with the beauty we'd arrived 
				at. Going to bed now.</p>

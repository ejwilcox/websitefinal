				<h2><b>Section Description</b></h2>
				<p>
					Los Pepitos and 4 new instrucutors met this austral fall, to spend 18 days together climbing in 
					Cerro Aguila. The group started getting competent belaying and moving on rock on a top rope setting, 
					then progressed to learning about building anchors, placing pro, rappeling and cleaning anchor. We
					had sunny days whn we hiked to swim in the narby lake, and a few weather days when we discussed about
					climbing history and ethics, had sopaipillas con pebre, drove to Puerto Ibanes to learn about local 
					pottery by our hostess Rayen Cayun and tested our skills in a rope olympics. We learned about the history
					of the different people that have lived in Patagonia and about local issues of land managment. 
					There were 2 climbing field trips, first to Aerodromo in Cerro Castillo and later to Maitenal in Pto
					Ibanez. A highlight was a visit from the high school kids of Cerro Castillo, who spent 2 days climbing
					with us and gifted a night of music and dancing, followed by a visit from NOLS intown staff on a climbing 
					day fully led by students. The section finished with students accomplishing many of their climbing
					goals.

					<p>
						Multipitching day with Erez and Christina! Woke up with some nerves but thankfully slept great.
						Out group face the repercussions of last nights tomfoolery. Gilbert was bearknapped. Had some
						mate with Erez before breakfast. There was no lesson this morning. I helped with cleaning then
						Erez and I got ready. Christina lent me her bag which I packed with my headlamp, sweatpants, 
						puffy, lunch, water, and rope. We hiked all the way back to where Nick and Izzy multipitched
						yesterday, talking about skiing mostly. Then Christina set everuthing up, began climbing while I
						belayed her. My nerves were really high at this point but after a few holds they went away and 
						I enjoyed the present moment. I whistled to myself and thought of the song "Acuas de Marzo" to
						calm myself. Climbed to Christina then belayed Erez up. Hung out there for a bit then repeated the process.
						Did this a few more times then arrived at the top. Was speechless due to the beauty of our surrounding 
						and the magnitude of what Erez and I were doing. It's my 6th day of climbing and I'm multipitching in
						Cerro Castillo, Chile. Extremely grateful.

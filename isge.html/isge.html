				<h2><b>Section Description</b></h2>
				<p>
					After the conclusion of the hiking section, Los Pepitos split themselves into two groups of seven.  
					This would be their final section: ISGE, or Independent Stduent Group Expedition. The previous three 
					prepared them to with the necessary skills in order to brave the Patagonia wilderness without 
					professional instructors. Before leaving, they met with a safety coordinator, Felipe. 
					Before leaving for the independent expedition, students prepared their travel plans. Since it was 
					eight days total, each member was assigned one travel day. The entirety of the expedition was 46
					kilometers in length. After the expedition was complete, Los Pepitos were picked up and driven back
					to the NOLS base. April 19, 2025 marked the graduation of the course. Every member of the group made
					it to graduation, which is more uncommon than you'd think. It was an emotional day, each member 
					realizing it might be a while before they see one another in person. This was the last course of the
					season. NOLS Patagonia wrapped up its operations, since it is now Winter in Patagonia!

				<h2>Journal Entry</h2>
				<h1>Date: 04/14/25</h1>
				<p>
					My favorite day of ISGE so far. Woke up to rain, it rained all night. Nick and Walt got out of the tent 
					and started breakfast. Sort of a slow morning. Erez initially thought we should stay back but weather improved
					and we decided to go. Because of the rain we had to go a bit south past our original river crossing. I was 
					in the lead at the beginning b/c I got the beta yesterday. Erez's quote was in my mind as the day began. "
					Become aerodynamic". That was my motto for the rest of the day as we began bushwhacking. I bobbed and weaved
					through trees until we eventually came across where our X originally was meant to be. We took a natural slide down
					to the river for our break. Started hiking again for around twenty minutes then bumped into the other group. 
					We talked for a while, excited to catch up with the people we'd been together with for eighty days. They told us
					a story of Josepha's backpack tumbling down the saddle. It was time to head out after that. Incredile day.
